# DNAbyte
A Python toolkit for DNA data storage.

This repo organises all software deliverables of the project, including: (i) encoding data, (ii) simulating the synthesis, storage, and sequencing of DNA based data.

DNAbyte was developed under the EIC Pathfinder Challenge MI-DNA DISC (www.midnadisc.eu). This project aims to bring a low-cost, energy-efficient, and fast data driven approach that can write, edit, store, and retrieve DNA-based data, more efficiently compared to current technologies. It was funded by the EU Commission in the framework of the Horizon Europe â€“ EIC Pathfinder Challenges programme under the Grant Agreement 101115215.
